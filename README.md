# flowDB: a database to enable storage and high-level analysis of flow cytometric data

This is the repository for Maia Bennett's CSCI 8876 Database Search and Pattern Discovery course project at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO). 

## The main aim of this project is to create a user-friendly database to facilitate analysis of primary flow cytometry data by the Denton Immunobiology Lab. 
- The first aim is to create a database (flowDB) that accurately stores flow cytometry data, donor metadata, and relevant gene ontologies 
- The second aim is to develop analytical methodologies to run FlowSOM, tSNE/viSNE, and GO analysis on stored flow cytometry data
- The third aim is to design a user-friendly interface to enable non-bioinformatics Denton Lab members analytical capacity of their data
